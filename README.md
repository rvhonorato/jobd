This is a central component [WeNMR](https://wenmr.science.uu.nl), a worldwide
e-Infrastructure for NMR and structural biology - operated by
the [BonvinLab](https://bonvinlab.org) at the [Utrecht University](https://uu.nl).

It enables interaction between the web backend and the
[research software developed in the Bonvinlab](https://github.com/haddocking) which
are offered as web services for a community of over
[52.000 users accross 154 countries](https://rascar.science.uu.nl/new/stats).

`jobd` is a lightweight Golang application designed to facilitate interaction with
research software through REST APIs. It is specifically engineered to be deployed
in multi-stage Docker builds, providing a flexible and portable solution for job
management and file transfer.

ðŸš§ Documentation is still a work in progess ðŸš§

## Features

Implements two primary REST API endpoints:

- `POST /api/upload` Allows backend systems or scripts to upload files to the container
- `GET /api/get/:id` Enables retrieval of files (results) from the container

Check the [API docs](https://rvhonorato.me/jobd) for more information

Use Cases

- Microservice-based job submission and file handling
- Simplified API interfaces for research software workflows

## Configuration

The application is optimized for containerized environments,
supporting multi-stage build patterns or simple binary execution.

In both ways the `jobd` version can be passed as a build argument:

```bash
docker build --build-arg JOBD_VERSION=v0.1.0 .
```

### Multi-stage build

First stage pulls the jobd executable from a specific image
Second stage incorporates the executable into a base research container
Enables seamless integration of job management capabilities into existing research
software containers

```dockerfile
ARG JOBD_VERSION=latest
FROM ghcr.io/rvhonorato/jobd:${JOBD_VERSION} AS jobd

FROM ghcr.io/haddocking/arctic3d:v0.5.1 AS base

WORKDIR /data
COPY --from=jobd /path/to/jobd /bin/jobd

ENTRYPOINT [ "/bin/jobd" ]
```

### Binary execution

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/haddocking/arctic3d:v0.5.1
WORKDIR /data

ARG JOBD_VERSION=v0.1.0
ARG JOBD_ARCH=linux_386

# Download and extract jobd binary
ADD https://github.com/rvhonorato/jobd/releases/download/${JOBD_VERSION}/jobd_${JOBD_VERSION}_${JOBD_ARCH}.tar.gz /tmp/
RUN tar -xzf /tmp/jobd_${JOBD_VERSION}_${JOBD_ARCH}.tar.gz -C /bin/ \
    && chmod +x /bin/jobd \
    && rm /tmp/jobd_${JOBD_VERSION}_${JOBD_ARCH}.tar.gz

ENTRYPOINT [ "/bin/jobd" ]
```

## Usage

Soon!

## Technical Characteristics

- Written in Golang for performance and simplicity
- REST API-based communication
- Lightweight and containerization-friendly
- Designed for research and scientific computing environments

The application provides a standardized, portable mechanism for programmatic file and job interactions across different research software platforms.
